BESTSELLER Task

**The challenge**
- Build a website with a table that lists all characters: name, gender, current status (dead or
alive), which species they are, the last known location, and number of episodes the
character has appeared in.
- The table should be expandable, and provide a picture of the character, name, gender,
status, species, origin, location and a detailed list of the episodes of the character (name,
season and episode).
- It should be possible to search for a specific character by name.
- You can get the data from The Rick and Morty API (see QR code below).
- You will build the website in React.
- You decide the layout (an example has been attached on the next page, but it doesnâ€™t have to
look like that).

**Feedback:**
- No typescript usage (wasn't in the challenge)  
- No coach splitting memorization lazyloading 
- useffect could be replaced with various other things
- was hard to see my problem-solving and debugging skills, REST could solve that
- commenting, structure, ux was good
- missed making the episode list of the challenge due to time constrains (name, season and episode)
